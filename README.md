## Bus Mall

I created a webpage for a company who wanted users to vote for their favorite products. The products had to generate randomly while making sure not to repeat any of the previous 3 images to keep an un-biased favorite. After the user votes 25 times we would be able to view the voting results, the number of views each product got and this was put into a beautiful bar chart for easy overview!
